            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
                In rural areas, farmers often struggle to sell their produce at fair prices due to limited market access and the presence of multiple intermediaries. These intermediaries typically buy produce from farmers at low prices and sell it at higher rates to urban retailers, resulting in significant profit margins for the middlemen and minimal returns for the farmers. This inefficient supply chain not only reduces the income of farmers but also inflates the cost of produce for end consumers.
